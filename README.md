# SentimentAnalysisOfProductReviews

Description: The topic uses CNN model combined with LSTM model to predict whether a comment is positive or negative

- Use data cleaning techniques such as: Text Preprocessing, Label Encoding, Tokenization, Embedding, Padding .
- Build machine learning models like Convolutional Neural Network, Long Short Term Memory with optimal hyperparameters
- Collect data from tiki website via API to get important information for prediction
- Divide the data into training, validation, and test sets to build optimal parameters and increase predictability of the model, avoiding overfitting by using Dropout classes.
- Visualize data to see an overview of the accuracy between machine learning models
